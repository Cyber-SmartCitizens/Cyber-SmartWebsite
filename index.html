                  Investment scams, though not common, can be devastating. They often start with an unsolicited call or email, pitching an enticing opportunity to invest in a new startup or rising stock. The scammer promises significant returns, implying missing out would be a mistake. After persuading the victim to invest, they request money for non-existent shares. To avoid falling victim, stay vigilant for warning signs and verify before investing.

                <div class="instruction-step">
                    <h2><strong>1. Make Sure to Have Safe Passwords:</strong></h2>
                    <p>The most important thing to do to keep your information safe online is to make sure that you have safe passwords. When creating a password, make sure to include a number, a capital letter, and a special character. Additionally, we also advise that you make your passwords more than ten characters.</p>

                    <p>It is important to make sure that you do not overuse the same password for many sites. Overusing the same password can lead to someone being able to have your email and password for any site that you may have. Make sure to regularly change your password, and have different variants for different sites.</p>

                <div class="instruction-step">
                    <h2><strong>3. Don't Email Personal Information:</strong></h2>
                    <p>In any case, make sure to not send important information through email. If you have to send personal information, and can’t do it in person, doing it through text messaging is best. If someone else’s email gets hacked, then they have access to all of your information. It is important to not send information such as credit card numbers and banking information through email.</p>

                    <p>Similar to the last point, sending pictures of important documents such as passports and social security cards can be very dangerous. If the email that you sent the information to gets hacked, then all of your information can be leaked. If you need to send important documents, try to do it in person, or through mail.</p>

            <p>While investment scams are not as prevalent, they can still be one of the most harmful. Investment scams normally begin with either a phone call, or an email. That message will first start with information about a new startup, or a new stock that is on the rise. During this message, the scammer will usually speak about how great of an opportunity this would be to invest in, and how later down the road, you will regret not investing in this company. After getting you to invest, the scammer will then normally have you transfer money for a “share” in the company, which does not really exist. When looking at potential investment scams, it is important to look for the following:</p>

            <div class="instructions">
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>1. Ask Questions:</strong></h2>
                <p>The most important thing to do when looking at investment scams is to ask questions. These can range from, “How many people have invested in the company, and can I speak to them?” Or, “Can I see some of the company's finances?” In these instances, if a scammer sends you back any documents, it is very important to see if these documents are real
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>2. Check How They Would Like You to Invest:</strong></h2>
                <p>While some investment opportunities many seem legit, it is still important to see where they want to you to send money to. If a “company” wants you to send money to a PayPal or CashApp, then they are defiantly not an actual company, and it is an investment scam.</p>

              these things:</p>

            <div class="instructions">
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>1. Look Who Sent the Email:</strong></h2>
                <p>Many phishing emails come from senders that do have reputable emails. While someone may claim that
                  they are from a larger tech company, do not always take their word; look at their email source. If
                  they have an email that may look like someone's personal email, then it is probably a phishing scam.

              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>2. Contact the Larger Company:</strong></h2>
                <p>Normally, phishing emails come from people who are trying to impersonate employees from larger
                  companies. If this is the case, then contact the larger company. Once in contact with the larger
                  company, then speak about the potential issue that was raised in the email and explain it to them. If
                  the company as a whole does not recognize the message that was sent out, then it is most likely a

            <p>Online shopping scams are one of the most popular online scams. Similar to phishing emails, tech support
              scams normally come from people trying to impersonate employees from larger companies. These normally
              start with phishing emails.

            <div class="instructions">
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>1. Contact the Larger Company:</strong></h2>
                <p>Instead of speaking on the phone with the number provided in the email, reach out to the larger tech
                  company. This will prevent any confusion. When speaking with the larger company, discuss the email you
                  have received, and ask if they have any information on the charge that you may have received. If they
                  do not, then you may have received the primary steps to an online shopping scam. If the larger company
                  does not know anything about what the email states, do not respond to the email, and report it as a
                  scam.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>2. Look Who Sent the Email:</strong></h2>
                <p>A lot of online shopping scams start with phishing emails. Many phishing emails come from senders
                  that do have reputable emails. While someone may claim that they are from a larger tech company, do
                  not always take their word; look at their email source. If they have an email that may look like
                  someone's personal email, then it is probably a phishing scam.</p>

              <p>Tech support scams can come in many forms. They can be a text message, email, phone call, or any other form of electronic communication. They normally start with someone reaching out to speak about a potential issue with your technology, and how they can offer to fix it. When looking at a tech support scam, it is important to consider the following:</p>

                      <p>If you receive any email that contains a link that could fix an issue with your phone or computer, do NOT click on the link. These links can often lead to computer viruses being installed on your computer, which can lead to a multitude of problems.</p>

These can range from, “Can you tell me what model device I have?” or “Can you confirm when I purchased this device?” With these clarifying questions, you will be able to figure out if a message is a tech support scam.</p>

              <h2>How to Avoid Social Media Scams</h2>
              <button class="buttonClose close-button5">Close</button>
            </div>
            <hr class="divideBlack" />
            <p>Hacking into personal social media accounts is easier than ever nowadays. This has led to millions of
              people losing hundreds of millions of dollars due to horrible scams on Instagram. If you ever receive a
              message like this, then follow these steps. It is first important to remember that anyone’s account can
              get hacked, so this could even be your closest friend or family member's account.</p>

            <div class="instructions">
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>1. Analyze the message:</strong></h2>
                <p>Ask questions like: “Why would they send this message, or is this really how they normally text me?”
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>2. Ask personal questions:</strong></h2>
                <p>The best way to tell if it is really them is to ask them personal questions. This could be questions
                  like: “Where was the last place we went to vacation together?” Or, “What is my favorite color?” It is
                  important to note that any questions you may ask should be things that they already could see on the
                  account. If someone has already hacked into a friend’s Instagram account, then they have access to
                  information such as their birthday and some names of people they follow. Despite the fact that this
                  may be your closest friend, still make sure to ask these questions just to verify.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>3. Reach out to the person directly on iMessages, or through email:</strong></h2>
                <p>The chance is that if someone wanted to ask for money from you, they would not ask through Instagram,
                  but instead through a phone call or a text. If they verify to you that they are in fact looking for
                  money, continue the discussion through text messaging, not Instagram. If not, then inform them that
                  their Instagram account has been hacked.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>4. Look for the accounts that ask you to send money to:</strong></h2>
                <p>Usually, people use their personal names in Venmo or PayPal accounts. Make sure to check that their
                  name is on the account that they are requesting you to send money to. Normally, scammers use made-up
                  names on PayPal accounts, or just input random letters. If you do not recognize the name on the PayPal
                  account, then it is most likely a scam. Make sure to verify with your friend in person beforehand.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>5. Talking in person or on the phone is best:</strong></h2>
                <p>The best thing to do is to speak to someone in person. If someone contacts you asking for money, make
                  sure to call them, or speak in person.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, hacking into other people's social media accounts is very easy in our modern world. You
              probably know someone who has had their account hacked in the past. If you ever notice that one of your
              accounts has been hacked, follow these steps.</p>

            <div class="instructions">
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>1. Check to See Who Has Been Messaged on Your Account:</strong></h2>
                <p>Scammers normally like to hack into accounts to message others to try to get them to send money to an
                  account. To see more about that common type of scam, click here. If you notice that many of your
                  friends have been messaged on social media, make sure to contact them through messages, WhatsApp, or a
                  phone call to inform them that you are in fact NOT asking for money.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>2. Try to Reset Your Password:</strong></h2>
                <p>Once you have identified that someone has hacked into your account, make sure to try to reset your
                  password. Most forms of social media have a way to reset your password directly in the app, however,
                  if it does not, then go to their website and see how to reset it on the web. Resetting the password to
                  your account normally signs all other users out of the account, so your hacker will most likely be
                  signed out of your account.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>3. Contact the Social Media Company Directly:</strong></h2>
                <p>Social Media companies deal with hacked accounts countless amounts of times every day. If your
                  account is hacked, reach out to the company directly, and they can help you with what your next steps
                  should be. This is the MOST helpful and important step.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="instruction-step">
                <h2><strong>4. Create a New Account with Better Security:</strong></h2>
                <p>If your account has been hacked, then most likely you will have to create a new account. When doing
                  this, make sure to set up updated security measures. These include a more complex password, or
                  two-factor authentication to make sure that your account is not hacked again in the future.</p>
